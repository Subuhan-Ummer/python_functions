# Python Functions Assignment

This repository contains my solutions for a Python assignment focused on functions. The assignment covers the usage of the `len()` function, defining custom functions, local vs global variables, and default parameters.

## Assignment Overview

1. **len() Function**
    - Used the `len()` function to find the length of a list.
    - Example code is provided to demonstrate how the function works.

2. **greet(name) Function**
    - A Python function `greet(name)` that takes a person's name as input and prints a personalized greeting: "Hello, [name]!".

3. **find_maximum(numbers) Function**
    - A Python function `find_maximum(numbers)` that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value without using the built-in `max()` function.
    - A loop is used to iterate through the list and compare values.

4. **Local vs Global Variables**
    - Explanation and demonstration of the difference between local and global variables in Python functions.
    - A program is included where both a global and a local variable have the same name, showing how Python differentiates between them.

5. **calculate_area(length, width=5) Function**
    - A function `calculate_area(length, width=5)` that calculates the area of a rectangle.
    - If only the length is provided, the width defaults to 5.
    - Example function calls demonstrate its behavior when called with and without the `width` argument.

## Screenshots

- A PDF file containing screenshots of the code and output is included in this repository.
